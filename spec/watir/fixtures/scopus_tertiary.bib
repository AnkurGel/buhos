abstract={Background: In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference. Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Context: In a previous study, we reported on a systematic literature review (SLR), based on a manual search of 13 journals and conferences undertaken in the period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2007. Objective: The aim of this on-going research is to provide an annotated catalogue of SLRs available to software engineering researchers and practitioners. This study updates our previous study using a broad automated search. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs published in the time period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2008. We contrast the number, quality and source of these SLRs with SLRs found in the original study. Results: Our broad search found an additional 35 SLRs corresponding to 33 unique studies. Of these papers, 17 appeared relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum and 12 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. The number of SLRs being published is increasing. The quality of papers in conferences and workshops has improved as more researchers use SLR guidelines. Conclusion: SLRs appear to have gone past the stage of being used solely by innovators but cannot yet be considered a main stream software engineering research methodology. They are addressing a wide range of topics but still have limitations, such as often failing to assess primary study quality. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Two tertiary studies, published in 2009 and 2010, identified and analysed 54 SLRs published in journals and conferences in the period between 1st January 2004 and 30th June 2008. Objective: In this article, our goal was to extend and update the two previous tertiary studies to cover the period between 1st July 2008 and 31st December 2009. We analysed the quality, coverage of software engineering topics, and potential impact of published SLRs for education and practice. Method: We performed automatic and manual searches for SLRs published in journals and conference proceedings, analysed the relevant studies, and compared and integrated our findings with the two previous tertiary studies. Results: We found 67 new SLRs addressing 24 software engineering topics. Among these studies, 15 were considered relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum, and 40 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. We found that the number of SLRs in software engineering is increasing, the overall quality of the studies is improving, and the number of researchers and research organisations worldwide that are conducting SLRs is also increasing and spreading. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the software engineering research community is starting to adopt SLRs consistently as a research method. However, the majority of the SLRs did not evaluate the quality of primary studies and fail to provide guidelines for practitioners, thus decreasing their potential impact on software engineering practice. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Background: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have gained significant popularity among Software Engineering (SE) researchers since 2004. Several researchers have also been working on improving the scientific and methodological infrastructure to support SLRs in SE. We argue that there is also an apparent and essential need for evidence-based body of knowledge about different aspects of the adoption of SLRs in SE. Objective: The main objective of this research is to empirically investigate the adoption, value, and use of SLRs in SE research from various perspectives. Method: We used mixed-methods approach (systematically integrating tertiary literature review, semi-structured interviews and questionnaire-based survey) as it is based on a combination of complementary research methods which are expected to compensate each others' limitations. Results: A large majority of the participants are convinced of the value of using a rigourous and systematic methodology for literature reviews in SE research. However, there are concerns about the required time and resources for SLRs. One of the most important motivators for performing SLRs is new findings and inception of innovative ideas for further research. The reported SLRs are more influential compared to the traditional literature reviews in terms of number of citations. One of the main challenges of conducting SLRs is drawing a balance between methodological rigour and required effort. Conclusions: SLR has become a popular research methodology for conducting literature review and evidence aggregation in SE. There is an overall positive perception about this relatively new methodology to SE research. The findings provide interesting insights into different aspects of SLRs. We expect that the findings can provide valuable information to readers about what can be expected from conducting SLRs and the potential impact of such reviews. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a major tool for supporting evidence-based software engineering. Adapting the procedures involved in such a review to meet the needs of software engineering and its literature remains an ongoing process. As part of this process of refinement, we undertook two case studies which aimed 1) to compare the use of targeted manual searches with broad automated searches and 2) to compare different methods of reaching a consensus on quality. For Case 1, we compared a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 1, 2004 and June 30, 2007 which used a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. We found that broad automated searches find more studies than manual restricted searches, but they may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers, or they are assessing research trends in research methodologies. For Case 2, we analyzed the process used to evaluate the quality of SLRs. We conclude that if quality evaluation of primary studies is a critical component of a specific SLR, assessments should be based on three independent evaluators incorporating at least two rounds of discussion. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Context: There has been an increase in research into global software development (GSD) and in the number of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) addressing this topic. Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.},

abstract={Distributed Software Development (DSD) emerged from the need to achieve geographically distant customers and currently, allows organizations have global customers and other benefits. This scenario has given rise to new Software Engineering challenges resulting from DSD particularities. Several Systematic Reviews were conducted to address these new challenges. The objective of this paper is to categorize systematic reviews conducted in DSD context. We used the systematic review method to identify SLRs (Systematic Literature Reviews) that address DSD aspects. This study is categorized as a tertiary review. Of fourteen SLRs, seven address aspects of managing distributed development. Four SLRs addressed topics of engineering process. The three remaining are related to Requirements, Design and Software Engineering Education in DSD. The topic areas covered by SLRs are limited, where the majority are focused on summarize the current knowledge concerning a research question. Despite the number of SLRs, the amount of empirical studies is relatively small. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Context Any newcomer or industrial practitioner is likely to experience difficulties in digesting large volumes of knowledge in software testing. In an ideal world, all knowledge used in industry, education and research should be based on high-quality evidence. Since no decision should be made based on a single study, secondary studies become essential in presenting the evidence. According to our search, over 101 secondary studies have been published in the area of software testing since 1994. With this high number of secondary studies, it is important to conduct a review in this area to provide an overview of the research landscape in this area. Objective The goal of this study is to systematically map (classify) the secondary studies in software testing. We propose that tertiary studies can serve as summarizing indexes which facilitate finding the most relevant information from secondary studies and thus supporting evidence-based decision making in any given area of software engineering. Our research questions (RQs) investigate: (1) Software-testing-specific areas, (2) Types of RQs investigated, (3) Numbers and Trends, and (4) Citations of the secondary studies. Method To conduct the tertiary study, we use the systematic-mapping approach. Additionally, we contrast the testing topics to the number of Google hits to address a general popularity of a testing topic and study the most popular papers in terms of citations. We furthermore demonstrate the practicality and usefulness of our results by mapping them to ISTQB foundation syllabus and to SWEBOK to provide implications for practitioners, testing educators, and researchers. Results After a systematic search and voting process, our study pool included 101 secondary studies in the area of software testing between 1994 and 2015. Among our results are the following: (1) In terms of number of secondary studies, model-based approach is the most popular testing method, web services are the most popular system under test (SUT), while regression testing is the most popular testing phase; (2) The quality of secondary studies, as measured by a criteria set established in the community, is slowly increasing as the years go by; and (3) Analysis of research questions, raised and studied in the pool of secondary studies, showed that there is a lack of ‘causality’ and ‘relationship’ type of research questions, a situation which needs to be improved if we, as a community, want to advance as a scientific field. (4) Among secondary studies, we found that regular surveys receive significantly more citations than SMs (p = 0.009) and SLRs (p = 0.014). Conclusion Despite the large number of secondary studies, we found that many important areas of software testing currently lack secondary studies, e.g., test management, role of product risk in testing, human factors in software testing, beta-testing (A/B-testing), exploratory testing, testability, test stopping criteria, and test-environment development. Having secondary studies in those areas is important for satisfying industrial and educational needs in software testing. On the other hand, education material of ISTQB foundation syllabus and SWEBOK could benefit from the inclusion of the latest research topics, namely search-based testing, use of cloud-computing for testing and symbolic execution. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Context: The use of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) requires expertise and poses many challenges for novice researchers. The experiences of those who have used this research methodology can benefit novice researchers in effectively dealing with these challenges. Objective: The aim of this study is to record the reported experiences of conducting Systematic Literature Reviews, for the benefit of new researchers. Such a review will greatly benefit the researchers wanting to conduct SLR for the very first time. Method: We conducted a tertiary study to gather the experiences published by researchers. Studies that have used the SLR research methodology in software engineering and have implicitly or explicitly reported their experiences are included in this review. Results: Our research has revealed 116 studies relevant to the theme. The data has been extracted by two researchers working independently and conflicts resolved after discussion with third researcher. Findings from these studies highlight Search Strategy, Online Databases, Planning and Data Extraction as the most challenging phases of SLR. Lack of standard terminology in software engineering papers, poor quality of abstracts and problems with search engines are some of the most cited challenges. Conclusion: Further research and guidelines is required to facilitate novice researchers in conducting these phases properly. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Context A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies (SLRs) covering numerous primary research studies on various aspects of agile software development (ASD) exist. Objective The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners. Method We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015. Results We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems. Conclusion SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={There has been an increasing interest in conducting Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) among Requirements Engineering (RE) researchers in recent years. However, so far there have been no tertiary studies conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of these published SLR in RE. In this paper we present a tertiary study of SLR that focus solely on RE related topics by following the guidelines of Evidence Based Software Engineering. We have conducted both automated search of major online sources and manual search of the RE and SLR related conferences and journals. Our tertiary study has identified 53 distinct systematic reviews published from 2006 to 2014 and reported in 64 publications. We have assessed the resulting SLR for their quality, and coverage of specific RE related topics thus identifying some gaps. We have observed that the quality of SLR in RE has been decreasing over the recent years.

abstract={Context: The quality of an Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is as good as the quality of the reviewed papers. Hence, it is vital to rigorously assess the papers included in an SLR. There has been no tertiary study aimed at re- porting the state of the practice of quality assessment used in SLRs in Software Engineering (SE). Objective: We aimed to study the practices of quality as- sessment of the papers included in SLRs in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study of the SLRs that have performed quality assessment of the reviewed papers. Results: We identified and analyzed different aspects of the quality assessment of the papers included in 127 SLRs. Conclusion: Researchers use a variety of strategies for quality assessment of the papers reviewed, but report lit- tle about the justification for the used criteria. The focus is creditability but not relevance aspect of the papers. Appro- priate guidelines are required for devising quality assessment strategies. Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Context: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a particular type of secondary study used as the main research method in evidence based research and practice. The starting point of a SLR should be a problem from the practice and the results should, somehow, have an impact on improving practice. Objective: To investigate the motivation of software engineering researchers to conduct a SLR and how the results of their reviews are potentially impacting the software engineering practice. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with authors of 120 SLRs published between 2004 and 2010 identified by three tertiary studies previously published. Results: Forty-four authors of SLR participate in the survey. The motivation behind the vast majority of the SLRs was to gather knowledge about a particular field of study. However, only six participants affirmed that their reviews actually had a direct impact in industrial practice. Conclusions: The use of SLR has increased over the years but they were mostly focused on academic problems and had very little impact on industrial practice. Therefore, the full potential benefits of evidence-based software engineering are not being achieved. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Context: The assessment of Threats to Validity (TTVs) is critical to secure the quality of empirical studies in Software Engineering (SE). In the recent decade, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was becoming an increasingly important empirical research method in SE. One of the mechanisms of insuring the level of scientific value in the findings of an SLR is to rigorously assess its validity. Hence, it is necessary to realize the status quo and issues of TTVs of SLRs in SE. Objective: This study aims to investigate thestate-of-the-practice of TTVs of the SLRs published in SE, and further support SE researchers to improve the assessment and strategies against TTVs in order to increase the quality of SLRs in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study by reviewing the SLRs in SE that report the assessment of TTVs. Results: We identified 316 SLRs published from 2004 to the first half of 2015, in which TTVs are discussed. The issues associated to TTVs were also summarized and categorized. Conclusion: The common TTVs related to SLR research, such as internal validity and reliability, were thoroughly discussed in most SLRs. The threats to construct validity and external validity drew less attention. Moreover, there are few strategies and tactics being reported to cope with the various TTVs. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Several researchers have reported their experiences in applying secondary studies in Software Engineering (SE), however, there is a lack of studies discussing the distinction between Systematic Mappings (SMs) and Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs). Aims: The objective of this paper is to present the results of a tertiary study conducted to collect and evaluate evidence to better understand similarities and differences between SLRs and SMs related to four aspects: Research question, search string, search strategy and quality assessment. Method: We identified 170 secondary studies that were reviewed to answer a set of Research Questions (RQ) related to the practical conduction of secondary studies in SE. Results: Results show that both SLRs and SMs have generic RQs, broad search strings, and adopt automatic search as search strategy. However, quality assessment has been more widely adopted in SLRs. Conclusions: In practice, only the quality assessment is conducted differently in SLRs and SMs.},

abstract={Evidence-based research has been matured and established in many other disciplines such as in Medicine and Psychology. One of the methods that has been widely used to support evidence-based practices is the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method. The SLR is a review method that aims to provide unbiased or fair evaluation to existing research evidence. The aim of this study is to gather the trends of evidence-based software engineering (SE) research in Malaysia in particular to identify the usage of SLR method among researchers, academics or practitioners. Based on our tertiary study, we found only 19 published work utilizing evidence-based practices in Malaysia within SE and Computer Science related domains. We have also conducted a survey during SLR workshops for the purpose of gathering perceptions on using SLR. The survey was participated by 78 academics and researchers from five universities in Malaysia. Our findings show that researchers in this country are still at preliminary stage in practicing evidence-based approach. We believe that knowledge and skill on using SLR should be promoted to encourage more researchers to apply it in their research © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Data is the source as well as raw format of evidence. As an important research methodology in evidence-based software engineering, systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are used for identifying the evidence and critically appraising the evidence, i.e. empirical studies that report (empirical) data about specific research questions. The 80/20 Rule (or Pareto's Law) reveals a 'vital few' phenomenon widely observed in many disciplines in the last century. However, the applicability of Pareto's Law to evidence distribution in software engineering (SE) is never tested yet. The objective of this paper is to investigate the applicability of Pareto's Law to the evidence distribution on specific topic areas in software engineering (in the form of systematic reviews), which may help us better understand the possible distribution of evidence in software engineering, and further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of literature search. We performed a tertiary study of SLRs in software engineering dated between 2004 and 2012. We further tested the Pareto's Law by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the distribution (over publication venues) of the primary studies reported in the existing SLRs. Our search identified 255 SLRs, 107 of which were included according to the selection criteria. The analysis of the extracted data from these SLRs presents a preliminary view of the evidence (study) distribution in software engineering. The nonuniform distribution of evidence is supported by the data from the existing SLRs in SE. However, the present observation reflects a weaker 'vital few' relation between study and venue than the 80/20 Rule statement. Top referenced venues are suggested when researchers search for studies in software engineering. It is also noticeable to the community that the primary studies are improperly or incompletely reported in many SLRs. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Software Process Improvement (SPI) has become one of the main strategic objectives in software industry. Companies make more investments in implementing software quality standards and models that focus on process assessment to improve their performance and productivity. To achieve these goals, companies focus on improving their process by means of improvement initiatives which may be implemented. To help practitioners find more innovative ways to manage and implement software process improvement initiatives efficiently, an important number of studies related to this topic have been emerged in recent years. Some of them, referred to as secondary studies, focused on the interpretation and synthesis of available published research works by giving an up to date state of art about SPI. This state of the art is provided in a form of literature surveys or in a methodological form using well established approaches such as systematic reviews or systematic mappings or tertiary studies. The objective of this paper is to identify and present the current secondary studies on SPI. The purpose is to discuss methods that these literature reviews of SPI use, their quality, and specific subjects that they cover. A set of survey research questions have been proposed and discussed through the investigation of 70 selected secondary studies collected from different digital libraries. The results show that success factors and issues related to implementation of SPI initiatives are the most studied, and there is a need to address in depth the measurement aspects in SPI. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Context. A decade ago, Kitchenham, Dyb and Jørgensen argued that software engineering could benefit from an evidence-based research approach similar that that used in medicine, introducing the basis for Evidence Based Software Engineering (EBSE). Objective. Our main goal is to understand the evolution of the use of systematic reviews as the main research method in EBSE, as proposed by Kitchenham et al., by investigating primary and tertiary studies that explore any aspect, theory, or concept around the use of systematic reviews in software engineering. Method. A systematic mapping study protocol was used to find and selected studies about EBSE and systematic reviews in SE, published between 2004 and 2013. Results. We selected 52 unique papers classified as non-empirical studies (12), empirical studies (31), and tertiary studies (9). Conclusion. SLR has become an important component of software engineering research with nearly 200 unique reviews catalogued by the tertiary studies. Most important limitations are related to the industrial relevance and application of the results of reviews and the poor use of synthesis method to aggregate evidence © 2014 ACM.},
