abstract={Context: The assessment of Threats to Validity (TTVs) is critical to secure the quality of empirical studies in Software Engineering (SE). In the recent decade, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was becoming an increasingly important empirical research method in SE. One of the mechanisms of insuring the level of scientific value in the findings of an SLR is to rigorously assess its validity. Hence, it is necessary to realize the status quo and issues of TTVs of SLRs in SE. Objective: This study aims to investigate the-state-of-the-practice of TTVs of the SLRs published in SE, and further support SE researchers to improve the assessment and strategies against TTVs in order to increase the quality of SLRs in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study by reviewing the SLRs in SE that report the assessment of TTVs. Results: We identified 316 SLRs published from 2004 to the first half of 2015, in which TTVs are discussed. The issues associated to TTVs were also summarized and categorized. Conclusion: The common TTVs related to SLR research, such as internal validity and reliability, were thoroughly discussed in most SLRs. The threats to construct validity and external validity drew less attention. Moreover, there are few strategies and tactics being reported to cope with the various TTVs.},

abstract={Evidence-based research has been matured and established in many other disciplines such as in Medicine and Psychology. One of the methods that has been widely used to support evidence-based practices is the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method. The SLR is a review method that aims to provide unbiased or fair evaluation to existing research evidence. The aim of this study is to gather the trends of evidence-based software engineering (SE) research in Malaysia in particular to identify the usage of SLR method among researchers, academics or practitioners. Based on our tertiary study, we found only 19 published work utilizing evidence-based practices in Malaysia within SE and Computer Science related domains. We have also conducted a survey during SLR workshops for the purpose of gathering perceptions on using SLR. The survey was participated by 78 academics and researchers from five universities in Malaysia. Our findings show that researchers in this country are still at preliminary stage in practicing evidence-based approach. We believe that knowledge and skill on using SLR should be promoted to encourage more researchers to apply it in their research.},

abstract={There has been an increasing interest in conducting Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) among Requirements Engineering (RE) researchers in recent years. However, so far there have been no tertiary studies conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of these published SLR in RE. In this paper we present a tertiary study of SLR that focus solely on RE related topics by following the guidelines of Evidence Based Software Engineering. We have conducted both automated search of major online sources and manual search of the RE and SLR related conferences and journals. Our tertiary study has identified 53 distinct systematic reviews published from 2006 to 2014 and reported in 64 publications. We have assessed the resulting SLR for their quality, and coverage of specific RE related topics thus identifying some gaps. We have observed that the quality of SLR in RE has been decreasing over the recent years. There is a strong need to replicate some of these SLR to increase the reliability of their results for future RE research.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an emerging and increasingly essential area of research, given the prospects of increasing the elderly world population. The establishment of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm provided several advances in the field of healthcare for older adults. However, the development of AAL platforms focused on older adults is still presenting several challenges. Many of these challenges are similar to those existing for IoT architectures (i.e., interoperability) and others are derived from the healthcare domain (e.g., patients and caregivers as end-users). In this paper, we present a survey of secondary studies on AAL platforms published between 2013 to 2017. Our focus resided in investigating the state-of-the-art of the adaptive AAL platforms for older adults assistance. We have established a set of research questions with which we seek to gain an overview of AAL platforms, development patterns, and the main challenges in this domain. We describe our search protocol, the execution, the selection of the papers, and the results obtained. Among the conclusions of our overview, we can mention the absence of a reference architecture for AAL platforms and some open questions (e.g., data privacy, usability, accessibility) present in this domain.},

abstract={This study aims to compare the use of targeted manual searches with broad automated searches, and to assess the importance of grey literature and breadth of search on the outcomes of SLRs. We used a participant-observer multi-case embedded case study. Our two cases were a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 2004 and June 2007 based on a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. Broad searches find more papers than restricted searches, but the papers may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers; if publication bias is not an issue; or if they are assessing research trends in research methodologies.},
