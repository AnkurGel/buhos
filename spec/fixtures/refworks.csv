To this end a qualitative analysis was conducted, through an interpretive action model, of the perception of six Spanish university professors from varying specializations within the social sciences field. A discussion group was conducted as an instrument for further investigation into this focus of study. Results indicate how professors with less experience and lower academic rank perceive more difficulties when adapting to the demands of evaluating agencies. Professors with higher academic rank recognize the impossibility of publishing varied, high-quality scientific material in the short term. The articles ends by proposing the need to review professor accreditation models, considering both contributions made by researchers and their multidisciplinary projection.

The care and thought with which many participants chose their names, and the meanings or links associated with those names, illuminated the importance of the process of naming.

Gatekeeping has been widely promoted as a key strategy to combat unnecessary institutionalisation. Its aim is to provide a range of services and a system of decision making based on assessments of children and families to ensure effective targeting of services. This paper provides details of research into the gatekeeping system in Bulgaria for children under three and examples from recent Bulgarian and international practice. It suggests that gatekeeping could benefit from a social development orientation including activities to combat poverty and promote social inclusion through supporting community and family strengths.

Rumination, or perseverative thoughts about negative experiences, may constitute a maladaptive coping strategy that mediates the associations between perceived discrimination, emotional distress, and aggression. Our sample consisted of 170 ethnic minority and 134 White American participants. For ethnic minority participants, we found a pattern of correlations consistent with rumination partially mediating a causal link between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms, hostility, anger, and aggression. In White participants, by contrast, the significant associations between perceived discrimination and these indices of emotional and behavioral distress were not statistically mediated by rumination.

A review of the literature for explanatory factors and conceptual frameworks reveals that, as with the general definitions of disproportionality and disparity, there is a need for increased precision and refinement of the current frameworks used to explain the occurrence of these phenomena in the child welfare system. In order to address these issues, an alternate conceptual framework is proposed, with explanatory factors organized into five major paths: 1) Disproportionate Need; 2) Human Decision-Making; 3) Agency-System Factors; 4) Placement Dynamics; and 5) Policy Impact. This comprehensive framework aims to enhance the theoretical basis relevant to future research, critical thinking, and analyzing responses to the issues of disproportionality and disparity in child welfare.", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,0190-7409, , , , , , , , ,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019074091300354X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.11.013, , , , ,ScienceDirect, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Different personological theories of identity development were discussed, including Erikson's theory of psychosocial development and Marcia's theory of identity statuses. Developmental systems theory was used to further the literature on African American adolescents' identity development, by integrating various views of identity development as they pertain to these youth. Furthermore, the formation of many aspects of identity may be an important coping and resilience process for such youth. In addition, directions for future research are discussed, including a consideration of the complexity of diversity that exists within the African American adolescent population, and a call for more longitudinal assessments of identity development is presented.

One of the protective factors that have emerged in the literature is religious coping. Religious coping, spirituality, and faithbased approaches to trauma recovery include endorsement of beliefs, engagement in behaviors, and access to support from faith communities. Compared with negative religious coping, spirituality and positive religious coping have been associated with decreased psychological distress, a finding established with survivors of child abuse, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, community violence, and war. This article focuses on spiritual and religious coping among survivors of child abuse, sexual violence, and war; however, research demonstrates increased use of positive religious coping among some survivors with higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder. Much of the scholarship in this area includes qualitative studies with populations who face increased vulnerability to interpersonal trauma. Research in this area covers the life span from childhood to later adulthood and encompasses both domestic and international studies. The implications of research findings are explored, and future research needs are described. This line of research supports the American Psychological Association (2010) ethical standards that note the recognition of spiritual and religious faith traditions as important aspects of the provision of ethical treatment. Researchers, clinicians, and advocates for trauma survivors are encouraged to attend to the faith traditions and beliefs of persons confronting the potential devastation of traumatic events.

The present study used a mixed-methods approach to explore parental self-regulation associated with PA. Data were collected from 36 parents with preschool-aged children. They were interviewed about their PA and their family's PA. Parents also completed PA and self-regulation questionnaires and wore an accelerometer for five days. Qualitative data were examined using an inductive approach to thematic analysis. It showed that parents felt that they had limited time for personal PA. Mothers' self-regulation was driven by an ethic of care and subjective norms, whereas fathers' self-regulation was driven by beliefs about the importance of autonomy. Nevertheless, both parents saw caring for their children as the main priority. Quantitative data were examined using multiple regression analyses. Results showed that different self-regulatory behaviours predicted the PA of mothers and fathers. Which predictors were significant depended on the type of activity and how it was measured.

One such method, ethnography, has crossed into multiple disciplines from anthropology, and indeed, community psychologists are becoming community ethnographers. Ethnographic work stands at the intersection of bridging universal questions with the particularities of people and groups bounded in time, geographic location, and social location. Ethnography is thus historical and deeply contextual, enabling a rich, in-depth understanding of communities that is aligned with the values and goals of community psychology. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the potential of ethnography for community psychology and to encourage its use within the field as a method to capture culture and context, to document process, and to reveal how social change and action occur within and through communities. We discuss the method of ethnography, draw connections to community psychology values and goals, and identify tensions from our experiences doing ethnography.

The foundation of concern for inequality is laid during adolescence, yet scholars understand little about the factors that influence whether and how adolescents come to express such concern. Arguing that structural and cultural contexts are just as consequential as whether adolescents themselves are members of disadvantaged groups, I draw on four theoretical perspectives to identify factors that influence adolescentsâ€™ concern for addressing inequality: the underdog thesis, intergroup contact theory, the education enlightens thesis, and ideological buttressing. Using representative restricted-use Educational Longitudinal Survey data, I find that 12th-gradersâ€™ beliefs are indeed influenced by more than their own demography: the diversity of their social milieu, the content of education in and out of the classroom, and ideological buttressing via political region and entertainment all influence whether they express concern for addressing inequality. These findings suggest extensions and amendments to the four theoretical perspectives and underscore the importance of studying structural and cultural factors that shape beliefs about inequality. The results also point to several interventions that may increase studentsâ€™ concern for inequality: involvement in civic-oriented extracurricular activities, more education in academic subjects that consider inequality, nurturing of cross-race friendships, and increased leisure reading.", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,0049-089X, , , , , , , , ,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X16303234,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.06.009, , , , ,ScienceDirect, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

With a focus on linguistic and bodily coordination in conversational contexts, I review the operational meaning of coordination in recent empirical research and related theorizing of embodied intersubjectivity. This discussion articulates what must be involved in treating linguistic meaning as dynamic processes of coordination. The coordination approach presents languaging as a set of dynamic self-organizing processes and actions on multiple timescales and across multiple modalities that come about and work in certain domains (those jointly constructed in social, interactive, high-order sense-making). These processes go beyond meaning at the level that is available to first-person experience. I take one crucial consequence of this to be the ubiquitously moral nature of languaging with others. Languaging coordinates experience, among other levels of behavior and event.

R.",Stigma and racial/ethnic HIV disparities: Moving toward resilience,American Psychologist,Am.Psychol.,2013,68,4,225,236, ,"Prior research suggests that stigma plays a role in racial/ ethnic health disparities. However, there is limited understanding about the mechanisms by which stigma contributes to HIV-related disparities in risk, incidence and screening, treatment, and survival and what can be done to reduce the impact of stigma on these disparities. We introduce the Stigma and HIV Disparities Model to describe how societal stigma related to race and ethnicity is associated with racial/ethnic HIV disparities via its manifestations at the structural level (e.g., residential segregation) as well as the individual level among perceivers (e.g., discrimination) and targets (e.g., internalized stigma). We then review evidence of these associations. Because racial/ ethnic minorities at risk of and living with HIV often possess multiple stigmas (e.g., HIV-positive, substance use), we adopt an intersectionality framework and conceptualize interdependence among co-occurring stigmas. We further propose a resilience agenda and suggest that intervening on modifiable strength-based moderators of the association between societal stigma and disparities can reduce disparities. Strengthening economic and community empowerment and trust at the structural level, creating common ingroup identities and promoting contact with people living with HIV among perceivers at the individual level, and enhancing social support and adaptive coping among targets at the individual level can improve resilience to societal stigma and ultimately reduce racial/ethnic HIV disparities.

Methods: Mixed-methodological study with 940 college women, including closed-ended survey questions and an open-ended question inquiring about participants' reactions to research participation. Results: Women generally reported low levels of emotional reactions to research participation, moderate levels of personal benefits to research participation, and a small to moderate percentage of participants reported shifting reactions toward their partners and relationships. In general, the presence of DV experiences (victimization more consistently than perpetration), lower relationship commitment and satisfaction, and higher posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms were related to lower levels of feeling more positive about one's relationship or partner as a result of research participation and higher levels of the following: emotional reactions to research participation, personal benefits to research participation, feeling negative toward and afraid of one's partner as a result of research participation, and thinking about ending the relationship as a result of research participation. Qualitative coding of women's open-ended responses was consistent with quantitative findings and provided additional details on how and why (e. g., insight, validation, and normalization) the study affected women's perceptions of their partners and relationships. Qualitative analyses also underscored the likely minimization and normalization of DV, some of which seemed to be related to research participation.

Using structural sampling, individual interviews were conducted with 10 teachers of the discipline, 26 students participated in focus groups, and 51 CP curricula and 10 programs used in universities in the Metropolitan and ValparaÃ­so regions were reviewed. By applying grounded theory methods and conducting a selective and inclusive analysis of all sources, an interpretive model accounting for the main results and their articulation was developed. The subordinate nature of CP in psychology training stands out, mainly due to the influence of the prevailing neoliberal model. Although ethical and political dimensions are regarded as essential, they remain at the discourse level; also, institutional and contextual factors interfere with them. The teacher-student dyad is a key facilitator of the incorporation of these dimensions in CP training. It is concluded that disciplinary training is eminently theoretical and lacks proper implementation in the communities themselves.

Developing a participatory and reflexive methodology: The project involved developing in-depth research conversations with three mothers and their children who had experienced domestic violence. Underpinned by poststructural feminism and relational ethics, a participatory approach to facilitate informal, nondefensive, participant-centred conversational spaces for the women and children was developed. Creating both the relational medium and the dialogical processes through which to engage with the women and children prompted multiple and complex challenges for the research team. Some members of the research team had prior experience of domestic violence, generating implications for ethical and reflexive research practice.

The analyses rely on data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) and 2000 US Census.

The HOME uses an observation/interview format to measure specific interactions between the caregiver and the child, various issues and events that might stimulate the child, and a variety of experiences provided at home or by family members that offer opportunity for growth and development. There are several versions to use from birth to age 3 (Infant-Toddler HOME), the most famous data come the late 60's (1968), it is composed by 45 items (HOME-45) clustered into six subscales. It has a back up of 40 years of publications, over 650 papers, associating with the children's language development, intellectual performance, and academic achievement or psychosocial and socioeconomic characteristics of the family. In Mexico, there are only two published version reports of the use of HOME-45. Most reports refer to the version of Cravioto from the late 60's, with 7 subscales and 62 items (HOME-62) from which there's poor information in the literature about the criteria for to interpreter the outcome results. The aim is to show the results of the implementation of both versions of HOME inventory, and provide criteria for interpretation in a sector of the Mexican population of low socioeconomic status. Material and Methods: We studied 1031 children and their homes from three communities of low socioeconomic status of central Mexico. Explaining the procedures and obtained informed consent, they were visited at home to implement the HOME Inventory and the socio-economic survey, with a 95% interobserver reliability. The procedures performed were approved by the Ethics and Research Committees from National Pediatric Institute. We applied the HOME-45 and HOME-62 in a integrated format to obtain the total score and each subscale from each version. It was also felt cut-off formed three groups with low stimulation (lowest fourth), middle stimulation (middle half) and high stimulation (upper fourth). The HOME-45 applies all the items to children 0 to 3 years; in the HOME-62 before 3 months old are evaluated only 50 items and after 3; 9; 12; 15 and 18 months old apply 54; 55; 57; 59 and 62 items respectively. Depending on the age, 26 to 36 items are common, representing from 58 to 80% of HOME-45 and 52 to 58% of HOME-62. There is no correspondence between the subscales of both versions, they have a different name and composition of items; so, we consider both versions as different. Social survey: A modified version of the socio-economic interview of the National Pediatric Institute was applied, therefore three levels were established: medium low, low and very low social-economic status. Statistical analysis: Four groups were formed by age range of children, to analyze the version HOME-45 and 6 groups for HOME-62 version, depending on the number of applicable items indicated in the format. The analysis related to HOME-62 considered only those items that the format indicates to apply for specific ages. Analyze was performed using JMP statistical software (version 5.01; SAS). We used ANOVA, Student's t test or Tukey Kramer's test to examine differences between means and chi square test to assess differences between proportions; p< 0.05 was considered statistical significance. Results: 52.7% of the children were female, aged 1 to 35 months (0=16.2 Â± 9.3 months) mother was the primary caregiver of the child at 87.8%. The mean mother's age was 26.5 Â± 5.7 years with a range of 14 to 43 years, the father's age was 29.8 Â± 7.34 years. Mother's education mean was 9 years, 24% elementary school or less. HOME-45 Inventory achieved mean score in the population of 31.02 Â± 5.68 points, equivalent to a hits proportion of 0.69 Â± 0.13, with limits between 0.51 (variety) to 0.81 (responsibity). We found statistical significance differences in the total score of HOME-45 Inventory according to socioeconomic and marital status, birth order of children, education and age of parents. There were also found differences between all subscales of HOME-45 with the socioeconomic status and parent's education. With scores of HOME-45 Total difference was found between children younger than 6 months respect to older. There were also differences in the same sense in the subscales except for Acceptance and Organization subscales. It was considered the cutoff point for low, medium and high stimulation in the total population (0-35 months), to total scale and each subscale, the most important differences observed occurred in children under 6 months of age. HOME-62 Inventory (Cravioto): The total score and the subscales of HOME-62 also showed associations with sociodemographic variables such as education, age and marital status from parents, socioeconomic family status and birth order of children. Scores reached at the HOME-62 were equivalent to the hits proportion of 0.74 Â± 0.1, all subscales showed mean higher than 0.5 and three above 0.8. There were major differences in the total score of HOME-62 considering the age group proposed, similar differences were observed in most of the subscales. The cut-off points for types of stimulation of total HOME-62 tend to increase with the age of the child. The same happened with the subscales except Frequency and Stability of adult contact and Emotional climate, were descended. It was compared the relationship between the two versions of HOME once the criteria proposed was applied: 719 family environments were similarly characterized by both versions (69.7%) and 235 environments (22.8%) were defined by the HOME-45 with great stimulation while 80 environments (7.8%) were defined by the HOME-62 with great stimulation too. Discussion: There are no benchmarks in the Mexican population for any of the two versions of HOME used. And the international benchmarks HOME-45 were obtained from American families for over 30 years, being important to have results related to its application and interpretation of HOME-45 in a sector of the Mexican population, allowing contrasting findings regarding those obtained in other latitudes. HOME-62 version is the most widely used in Mexico, but little has been reported about the achieved scores, because there are no criteria for interpretation. The values proposed in this paper can be used in future comparisons with the results of other studies. Differences in scores of each version of HOME according to the age of the children, make it necessary to show the results adjusted by age ranges, common procedure in several instruments. The results of HOME-45 in the population were similar to those obtained in other data, there were no statistical differences with the Little Rock values in the total score, and it existed with the subscales of Acceptance and Organization. Like in that population, the tendency to increase the total score of HOME-45 with age was due mainly to Learning materials and Variety subscales. The results of HOME-62 provide benchmarks for its interpretation in 6 age group and all subscales. If they are applied to the results of the Cravioto's investigation, they are able to differentiate families with a history of malnourished children in the early years of life. Both versions showed ability to discriminate socio-economic characteristics of family. It is necessary to report results of the implementation of HOME in different contexts in qualitative and quantitative terms for a proper comparison and interpretation of the differences between groups as well as analyzing the relationship between the specific results in the subscales of both versions with the development, behavior and welfare of children.", , ,, , , , ,,,, , , ,"Affiliation: Instituto Nacional de PediatrÃ­a, Mexico; Affiliation: Universidad AutÃ³noma Metropolitana, Mexico", ,Spanish, , ,Experiencia de la aplicaciÃ³n y criterios para la interpretaciÃ³n de dos versiones del Inventario HOME para infantes de 0 a 3 aÃ±os de vida, ,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79951571168&partnerID=40&md5=4b615c8a6c9194b49277bbefa0c4aa21, , , , ,SCOPUS,Scopus, ,4 September 2017, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Perceptions and experiences of single-sex public education,Children and Youth Services Review, ,2013,35,8,1174,1181,Single-sex education;Public schools;Race;Gender;Poverty,"Abstract There has been a widespread increase in single-sex public schooling in the U.S. following 2006 changes to the Department of Education regulations motivated by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Single-sex public schooling is viewed as a means to improve the educational experiences and performance of low-income youth of color. Yet little is known about its effects and efficacy, particularly for these populations. This article is based on a community-based participatory research project, on which high school students and university researchers collaborated, conducted in a low-income, African American high school implementing single-sex courses. Our findings challenge proponents' key assumptions that single-sex education will improve the academic achievement of low-income youth of color by 1) eliminating distraction from the other sex; 2) addressing the different learning styles of girls and boys; and 3) remedying inequities by offering these youth opportunities traditionally afforded to more privileged youth. While some distractions were decreased, others were increased or ignored; racialized stereotypes of hypersexuality and essentialized notions of gender were reinforced; and students felt punished rather than privileged by being separated by sex. We conclude that single-sex education as a public school option is a neoliberal approach to addressing low achievement that deflects attention from the structural inequities that created the problem and implicitly blames those experiencing oppression.", , ,,"Place, Power, and Possibility:Remaking Social Work with Children and Youth", , , ,,,, ,0190-7409, , , , , , , , ,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740913001205,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.04.004, , , , ,ScienceDirect, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
Journal Article,"Hanna,P.","Foucauldian Discourse Analysis in Psychology: Reflecting on a Hybrid Reading of Foucault When Researching ""Ethical Subjects""",Qualitative Research in Psychology, ,2014,11,2,142,159,ethics;Foucauldian Discourse Analysis;knowledge;power;reflexivity,"This article attempts to address a novel dilemma the author recently faced when undertaking qualitative psychological research into sustainable tourism. The article embraces notions of reflexivity to highlight how the research process was far removed from the sanitised version often presented in research methods textbooks. The article provides a reflexive account of the struggles of analysing Internet and interview data in relation to sustainable tourism via the dominant version of Foucauldian Discourse Analysis familiar to many qualitative/critical psychologists. Turning to an account of Foucault's later work on ethics, this article presents an alternative approach to Foucauldian Discourse Analysis that adopts a hybrid reading of Foucault's work on power, knowledge, and ethics. Drawing on Foucault's four precepts helps us explore the ways individuals ""cultivate the self as an ethical subject,"" and interview data are presented to highlight the ways such an approach can enrich analysis. It is concluded that while presenting issues surrounding understandings of structure and agency, such an approach did offer a pragmatic solution to an ethical question and may indeed be useful in a range of other areas.

The One-way ANOVA and Linear Mixed Models used a propensity score matching method were administered to identify to what extent urban students utilized inter-district open enrollment in a Midwestern city and to compare their performances on standardized tests before and after the school transfer had occurred. The results indicated that open enrollment provided black students and students in the child welfare system with equal access to racially and socioeconomically integrated schools. However, these students' academic performance was not significantly enhanced by their open enrollment, except the 3rd grade student achievement in math. The results raised questions about the characteristics of open enrollment.

In addition, as policy interventions to prevent racially segregated schools have stalled, progress toward reducing these achievement gaps has also slowed. This exploratory study employs multi-level modeling to examine how risk and protective factors in students' schools, homes, peer groups, and neighborhoods relate to behavior and academic performance. We examine whether these relationships depend on the racial composition of the school and, in particular, the concentration of African American students in schools. The findings indicate that protective school, home, peer group, and neighborhood environments characterized by social support and safety are associated with positive academic outcomes and behavior. Students attending more segregated schools in which the majority of students are African American report worse behavioral and academic outcomes than students in other schools, even when controlling for other important dimensions of the school environment, school climate, school safety, and poverty.

In addition, it seeks to understand the way in which researchers make decisions about cases of plagiarism when they are implicated as evaluators or editors of scientific publications. For this investigation of a qualitative nature, in-depth interviews were conducted in order to account for personal experiences and perceptions narrated directly by 51 Mexican senior researchers. The results reveal contradictions in the importance that investigators state they give to plagiarism and their close-up perception of this phenomenon, with the actions they carry out in the face of plagiarism and their experiences over the course of their careers. Moreover, the study permits the identification of some prevailing criteria for deciding not to pursue certain cases of plagiarism fully.

Twenty-six Japanese and 18 U.S. elementary school educators participated in individual interviews and discussed their experiences and perceptions of special education policies and their local implementation. Educators in both countries expressed common challenges, specifically, balancing legal requirements with everyday practices, adjusting to policy shifts, and negotiating support for children within and outside of their classrooms. Yet their experiences were culturally nuanced reflecting 1) relatively flexible (Japan) or fixed (U.S.) legal requirements, 2) shifts to more specialized (Japan) or more classroom-based (U.S.) support, and 3) established practices of classroom-based support (Japan) or pull-out support (U.S.).

Eighteen participants aged 15Ã¢â‚¬â€œ24 (12 girls and 6 boys), representing four ethnic minority groups, participated in focus groups and in-depth interviews and shared their responses to racial discrimination against them. Analysis of the data from the four discussion groups reveals that racism occurs in everyday situations and places, a lot of times manifesting itself as subtle forms of discrimination. Our findings also suggest that most of the participants tend to employ non-confrontational approaches when dealing with racial violence against them, and provide us with the rationale behind their intentions. Further, youth are not uniformly impacted by racialized events, and therefore the coping strategies they use vary based on individual and contextual factors. Three common strategies for healing can be derived from the participantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ narratives: expressive-emotional, spiritual-forgiving and communicative-relational. We discuss our findings in the light of theoretical frameworks of resilience and coping approaches and argue that young peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subjective appraisals of racialized events as well as contextual factors need to be addressed in any discussion on coping and resilience within minority youth populations.

We know from general theories of occupational health psychology that certain work factors will have a greater impact on well-being than others. Work engagement is positively related with occupational health, while burnout and workaholic tendencies relate negatively. An individual's resources can buffer against these negative effects. Specifically, the environmental resource of social support can impede the impact and instance of workaholism and has a positive influence on burnout. Social support is often encouraged by sport psychologists in protecting an athlete's well-being. Drawing on theory and research from work and organizational, health and social psychology we explore the lived experiences of burnout and work engagement among applied sport psychologists, investigating their perceptions of how these experiences impact their well-being. Thirty participants from five countries were asked, using semi-structured interviews, to recall specific incidents when feelings of work engagement and burnout occurred. We examined the influence of social support and its impact on these incidents. Thematic analysis revealed that burnout is frequently experienced despite high levels of work engagement. Sources of social support differ between groups of high burnout versus low burnout, as does reference to the dimensions of work engagement. Avenues for future research including investigating the role of mindfulness and therapeutic lifestyle changes for practitioners are outlined.

A.",Qualitative social research and ethical dilemmas: From empty ethics to situated ethics,Empiria, ,2016, ,34,101,120,Empty ethics;Qualitative social research;Reflexivity;Responsibility;Situated ethics,"During the second half of the twentieth century a debate grew up around the ethical responsibilities arising out of research practices. The debate, initiated in the field of biomedical research in the aftermath of the Second World War, was clearly intended to regulate research on humans. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, the debate spread to the sphere of social science. The institutionalisation of this debate and its general framework of reference have been reflected in a proliferation of ethics committees of different sorts and in the promotion of a range of mechanisms to regulate conduct and practice in the field (essentially ethical guides). The purpose is to avoid harming the people participating in the research and to safeguard their wellbeing, autonomy and dignity. To achieve this goal, three fundamental principles are absolutely essential: informed consent, confidentiality of information and respect for participant anonymity. The aim of this paper is to review the scope of these principles from the perspective of qualitative social research. By its very definition, such research comes up against ethical dilemmas that cannot be resolved using a generic ethical code based on standard procedures. The ethical dilemmas of qualitative process-centred research can only be resolved using situated ethics, which force researchers to reflect at all times on the ethical responsibility of their work and make decisions tailored to each specific research case vis-Ã -vis the reach of the ethical principles of consent, confidentiality and anonymity.",Cited By :1, ,, , , , ,,,, , , ,"Affiliation: Universidad Del PaÃ­s Vasco, Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, Spain", ,Spanish, , ,InvestigaciÃ³n social cualitativa y dilemas Ã©ticos: De la Ã©tica vacÃ­a a la Ã©tica situada, ,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84970025007&partnerID=40&md5=8efc0e665bf823ad6a5f7905e96fd74e, , , , ,SCOPUS,Scopus, ,4 September 2017, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

We show that gender differences in college major selection remain substantial, even for a cohort in which rates of enrollment in postsecondary education are more than ten percent higher for young women than for young men. Consistent with other recent research, we demonstrate that neither gender differences in workâ€“family goals nor in academic preparation explain a substantial portion of these differences. However, the occupational plans of high school seniors are strong predictors of initial college major selection, a finding that is revealed only when occupational plans are measured with sufficient detail, here by using the verbatim responses of students. We also find that the association between occupational plans and college major selection is not attributable to workâ€“family orientation or academic preparation. Finally, we find gender differences in the associations between occupational plans and college major selection that are consistent with prior research on STEM attrition, as well as with the claim that attrition also affects the selection of majors that are gateways into doctoral-track medicine. We discuss the implications of the predictive power of occupational plans formed in adolescence for understanding sex segregation and for policies intended to create a gender-balanced STEM and doctoral-level medical workforce.", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,0049-089X, , , , , , , , ,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X13000598,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.03.008, , , , ,ScienceDirect, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This special issue focuses on a range of methodological issues that can arise while conducting qualitative research online. The authors are seen to acknowledge the power relations that shape online spaces and relationships, and to reflexively and continually consider their roles in data collection or generation. The articles presented in this special issue also highlight ways in which critical qualitative researchers can innovatively negotiate the ethical issues that can occur within a dynamic context, and challenge the status quo through conducting this type of research. Online spaces continually change and present ongoing opportunities and challenges for researchers, yet, this special issue illustrates how critical qualitative researchers are well equipped to continue developing this line of research.

While the link between household resources and food insecurity is well-established, family income alone does not explain food insecurity; neighborhood disadvantage, shown to affect other areas of children's development, may also play a role in food insecurity. This study examines associations between neighborhood poverty and children's food insecurity, and whether family characteristics account for identified associations. We merge data on kindergarten-age children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten 2010â€“11 Cohort (ECLS-K:2011) with data on poverty rates from the American Community Survey (ACS) and on food access from the USDA's Food Environment Atlas using children's residential census tracts (N = 12.550 children in 3750 tracts). Using a series of multilevel models, we test for associations between neighborhood poverty, household economic, demographic, and parenting characteristics, and food insecurity at the child, adult, and household levels. Children living in higher-poverty neighborhoods are more likely to experience food insecurity than those in lower-poverty neighborhoods. Associations between neighborhood poverty and household- and adult-level food insecurity disappear when household characteristics are controlled. However, living in a very high poverty neighborhood remains predictive of child-level food insecurity, which may be an indicator of severe hardship. Findings indicate that neighborhood poverty may be a useful proxy to identify vulnerable children.", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,0190-7409, , , , , , , , ,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740916301505,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.05.006, , , , ,ScienceDirect, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Chicago implemented a â€œdouble-doseâ€ English policy in 2003.

I use policy-induced variation to infer the policy effect on studentsâ€™ reading achievement and the effect mediated by classroom peer ability change. Results show very weak, but positive effects of taking double-dose English for students with average skills. However, potential benefits of doubled instructional time are likely to be offset by negative effects of declines in classroom peer ability. Students with very weak skills experienced minimal change in classroom peer ability, and two-period coursework is likely to benefit these students.", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,0049-089X, , , , , , , , ,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X15000034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.12.012, , , , ,ScienceDirect, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The relationship between ethnic identification, coping options, and life satisfaction among South Asian Canadians",Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science, ,2015,47,1,12,20, ,"Identifying with one's ethnic group can contribute to the well-being of racial/ethnic minorities; however, little research has investigated the mechanisms that account for this relationship. Using a sample of South Asian Canadians, we examined whether this relationship can be explained in part by appraisals of intergroup coping options-beliefs about how one's ingroup as a whole can respond effectively to discrimination. Participants appraised the availability of 2 individual coping options and 2 intergroup coping options. The 2 individual coping options included appraisals about personally being able to avoid potential instances of discrimination (proactive avoidance), as well as being able to successfully regulate the negative emotions stemming from perceived discrimination (emotion regulation). The 2 intergroup coping options included appraisals about one's ethnic group working together to better their status (collective action) as well as ingroup members being able to effectively deal with negative societal beliefs about their group (social creativity). Participants who highly identified with their ethnic group reported greater satisfaction with their lives. Of the 4 coping options, collective action and social creativity were simple mediators of the relationship between ethnic identification and life satisfaction. Collective action emerged as the lone unique mediator when using the more robust test of multiple mediation. The results provide further evidence that group identification promotes well-being for racial/ethnic minorities, in part, because it encourages beliefs about one's group effectively responding to discrimination.

Using data from the Education Longitudinal Study, we find that Latino/a students and parents indeed have stronger preferences than white students and parents for living at home during college. For students, most differences in preferences for proximate colleges are explained by socioeconomic status, academic achievement and high school/regional differences. Moreover, controlling for socioeconomic background and prior achievement explains most racial/ethnic gaps in college application and attendance among high school graduates, suggesting that familism per se is not a significant deterrent to college enrollment above and beyond these more primary factors. However, results indicate generational differences; cultural factors may contribute to racial/ethnic gaps in parental preferences for children to remain at home.", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,0049-089X, , , , , , , , ,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X15000095,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.12.018, , , , ,ScienceDirect, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Most previous research finds residential mobility has negative effects on children's educational attainment, delinquency, substance abuse, and physical and mental health. Previous research, however, does not fully explore whether the effect of mobility differs by child race/ethnicity, in part because many of the samples used for these studies were majority white or exclusively non-white or disadvantaged. In addition, previous research rarely fully accounts for factors that predict selection into mobility and that may also be related to the outcome of interest. This study simultaneously addresses both of these limitations by estimating the effect of moving homes on children's emotional and behavioral wellbeing using first difference models and a diverse longitudinal sample from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods.

Subsequently, school choice is hypothesized to diminish stratification in schools. Data from one urban school district is analyzed to test these hypotheses. We specifically examine which factors influence the propensity for parents to participate in choice, and how school choice changes the racial/ethnic and economic composition of schools. We further examine how school choice influences similar changes within distinct sociogeographic areas within the district. We find that families who are zoned to more racially/ethnically and economically diverse schools in sociogeographically diverse areas are more likely to participate in school choice.

Journal Article,"Plaut,V. C.;Thomas,K. M.;Hebl,M. R.",Race and ethnicity in the workplace: Spotlighting the perspectives of historically stigmatized groups,Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, ,2014,20,4,479,482, ,"One might argue that race and ethnicity influence the workplace setting more than any other setting. The workplace provides unique opportunities to express one's identity and to work interactively with others in various competitive and cooperative situations. The workplace also provides opportunities for the expression of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination. People do not simply leave their racial and ethnic identities at home, and the workplace is not immune from societal forms of racial and ethnic bias. In short, race and ethnicity are salient in and matter in a variety of ways at work. Moreover, people spend a lot of time at work. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2013a), employed Americans (aged 25 to 54 with children) spend almost 9 hr a day working, and spend more time working than in any other activity. Additionally, 85% of employed persons (15 years and older) report doing some or all of their work at their workplace, and they spend substantially more time working at the workplace than at home (7.9 hr vs. 3 hr; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013b). Despite the salience of race and ethnicity in the work context, and the significant amount of time spent at work, journals that emphasize culture, race, and ethnic studies rarely focus on workplace discrimination, or on other stressors and opportunities that racial and ethnic minorities experience in the workplace. Furthermore, journals that emphasize work devote relatively little attention to the workplace realities of racial and ethnic minorities from the perspective of members of those groups. The need for greater attention to, and more research on, racial and ethnic identity and experiences in the workplace inspired our managing editor, Michael ZÃƒÂ¡rate, and our team of coeditors to create this special issue of Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology. Our call for papers sought articles using I/O constructs and research conducted in business environments that focused on racial and ethnic minority experiences. We also were particularly interested in identifying and highlighting workplace issues from the perspective of racial and ethnic minorities. We privileged this lens because much of the work on ethnic and racial minority issues, including in the workplace, has been conducted from the perspective of majority ""perceivers"" rather than from the perspective of members of historically stigmatized groups. Thus, we know a great deal about the way in which perceivers express their prejudice and moderator conditions of such prejudice, but we know relatively less about how prejudice is experienced by its targets. Although there are exceptions, this trend generally has translated into a focus on the prejudiced attitudes of White Americans, and on the effects of these attitudes on members of racial and ethnic minority groups, thus decentering the voices of the very groups this research often seeks to benefit or at least understand (Wildman & Davis, 1996). Of course, there could be other reasons for the relative lack of attention to racial and ethnic minorities' perspectives, such as the availability of employees of color as research participants (see Thompson, Bergman, Culbertson, & Huffman, 2013). Regardless of the reasons, this focus has led to a number of assumptions about how race and ethnicity matter in the workplace and a limited sense of the complexity of what people of color experience in the workplace (Nkomo, 1992). Of course, research from the ""perceiver"" side can tell us much about, for example, individuals' propensities to discriminate (Dovidio & Gaertner, 1986; Eagly & Karau, 2002), reactions to discrimination claimants (Kaiser & Miller, 2001), mentors' adoption of protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©s (D. A. Thomas, 1990), majority group members' feelings of threat (Craig & Richeson, 2014; Plaut, Garnett, Buffardi, & Sanchez-Burks, 2011), diversity.

In the course of their archival research, psychobiographers often uncover private information on the lives of historic psychologists that may never have been intended for public view and scrutiny. As such, psychobiographers need to balance considerations of the postmortem privacy of historic figures with the potential benefit to psychological science of revealing private information. Federal research guidelines and the ethical principles of the American Psychological Association concern themselves primarily with research on living subjects and are generally silent on best ethical practices regarding deceased historic and public figures. Using the case of William James's possible sojourn at McLean Hospital as an example, this article examines legal and ethical issues regarding the postmortem privacy protections of influential psychologists. An actuarial model is presented that recommends the postmortem time period after which private information, including mental health records, may become open to researchers.

This article introduces some of their forms after discussing the theoretical framework from which they are derived. Although they are based within personal and relational construct psychology, they can be used within any theoretical approach interested in the study of and intervention in human relationships. Kelly's sociality corollary is a deeply heuristic formulation that presages many similar concepts in contemporary use, such as theory of mind and mentalization. But the corollary is open to critique and further elaboration. As originally stated, it is restricted to the construing of one other person or position in a relationship. This enables us to elaborate the relationality corollary that includes a person's construing of relationships and interactions with two or more others, giving us a deeper understanding of group situations. This involves developing a conception of different levels of interpersonal construing. These can be nicely captured using qualitative grids, and an understanding of this helps the interviewer in designing the grid form suitable for the task in hand.}", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,1072-0537}, ,"Procter, H (Reprint Author), 70 Staplegrove Rd, Taunton, Somerset, England.

Despite its widespread use, almost no research has focused critically on the model's operationalized definition or its implementation and evaluation in training programs. This study provides an overview of how training directors in counseling psychology currently define, implement, and evaluate the scientist-practitioner model within their respective programs. A multi-methods online survey was distributed to 50 counseling psychology training directors. Qualitative responses from 32 respondents were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Non-thematic observations on response form/style were also summarized. Key findings suggest that counseling psychology training directors define the model in at least three broad ways. Some definitions are inconsistent with each other. Furthermore, basic program requirements are often used as the basis for both implementing and evaluating graduate programs' use of the training model. Lastly, many training directors rely on previous responses or published program descriptions in their answers. Implications include the ethics regarding the lack of clarity and consistency of the model's current use, advancement of the model beyond an abstraction to concrete operationalization, and concern about other applied specialties in psychology potentially having similar problems with the model.}", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,0951-5070}, ,"Ridley, C (Reprint Author), Texas A\&M Univ, Dept Educ Psychol, College Stn, TX 77834 USA.

Psychologistsâ€™ use of qualitative data obtained or generated online for research purposes poses unique challenges because of the â€œtraceabilityâ€ of quotes, often sensitive content of data and potential impact on both individuals and online communities. In this article, working within a framework that goes beyond â€œprocedural ethicsâ€ to examine â€œethics in practice,â€ ethical issues associated with conducting qualitative research within online communities are identified. These include tensions over public/private space, authorship versus human research participants, informed consent, anonymity and pseudonymity, covert research, deceptive research identities, reactions to being researched, and the quality of data obtained. Prior to conducting qualitative research in online communities, researchers have an ethical obligation to identify and weigh possible risks and benefits to both the community and community members. Sensitivity to the specific online community and continued ethical consideration throughout the conduct and reporting of the research are required.

While extant research has demonstrated a link between community context and child maltreatment rates, there is a dearth of research examining the potential relationship between social conditions in a community and the child welfare system's response to allegations of neglect. This study examined the relationship between child- and community-level characteristics and the decision to place a child in foster care. Two data sets were linked, one containing detailed observations of community conditions (e.g., cigarette and alcohol advertisements) and a second with individual child level information about child welfare investigations. Multilevel models allowed for the simultaneous understanding of child- and community-level characteristics. The results indicated strong associations between individual characteristics and foster care placement. The race or ethnicity of the child was a strong predictor of entry into foster care, and young children were much more likely to be placed in foster care than older children. Furthermore, community factors were also associated with placement into foster care. Specifically, the presence of litter and graffiti and the lack of security signage in a neighborhood appeared to impact the decision making process for foster care.", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,0190-7409, , , , , , , , ,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019074091400423X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2014.12.011, , , , ,ScienceDirect, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
Journal Article,"Romero,M.;RodrÃ­guez,E. M.;Durand-Smith,A.;Aguilera,R. M.",Twenty five years of qualitative research on mental health and addictions with hidden populations. First part,Salud Mental, ,2003,26,6,76,83,Addictions;Hidden populations;Mental health;Qualitative research,"Scientific research is not a neutral task. The existence of several paradigms and, as a consequence, different methodological approaches to study social reality, is an evidence of this statement. According to IbaÃ±ez, the couple quantitative-qualitative is the most polemic one. There are not only different types of techniques, but the main difference lays in the paradigms that each one responds to. According to Guba and Lincoln, paradigms can be seen as a group of basic beliefs related to last principles. They represent a vision of the world that defines, for those who use them, the nature of the world, the place of the individual in it, and the range of possibilities between them. Each paradigm answers three closely related questions: 1. A definition of the form and nature of reality; 2. A definition of the kind of relation established between the scientific who knows and the reality that is known, and 3. A definition of the specific methods that can be used to know that reality. According to Castro, for the qualitative approach what matters is observing, listening, and comprehending, so the level of reality that is known is a subjective one. The actors are the ones who create the social order through interaction and not the other way around. This approach favors comprehension rather than explanations, and the analysis of the subjects and individuals is carried out at a micro-level. Because of that, this interpretative approach is the one used to develop inductive knowledge, assuming that the meanings obtained are diverse. This kind of descriptive, analytic, and explorative approach is the best way to study hidden populations. Nonetheless, trying to define hidden populations takes us to a variety of problematic questions. If the main characteristic of these populations is the fact that they are hidden, how can one be sure that they exist and, if they do, how and why have they stayed hidden? Subsequently, once they are described, are we still talking about hidden populations? How can those populations create such great expectations being hidden? Hidden Populations. They have two characteristics: first, since there is no a sampling frame for these populations, their limits and size are known; then, there is a strong concern about privacy because given the illegal or stigmatized behaviors involved in this kind of studies, people do not always want to participate or give true information in order to protect their privacy. The traditional research methods cannot obtain reliable samples, and are inefficient because of the rareness of the hidden populations. Other definitions of the hidden populations refer mostly to the characteristics of the target group, such as wether they have a ""low social visibility"", and the odds of reaching the members of a specific population that will give reliable information. There is also the question of comparing the subgroup size with a wider population. It is necessary to make clear the difference between vulnerable and hidden populations. Vulnerable populations are in greater risk of getting certain disorders. Nevertheless, the risk is relative to the point of the vital cycle at which a person is in. In that way, children, elderly people, and disabled people are socially recognized as vulnerable groups because there is a record and a census of their needs. In the other hand, hidden populations, euphemistically speaking, refer to those who are in disadvantage and those who are deprived of their civil rights: homeless people and migrants; chronically ill people; those who have been expelled from school; criminals; prostitutes; in some societies, persons who have a different sexual orientation from the hegemonic one; young delinquents; gang members; those who run away from their homes; street children; and other people from the streets, and until a few years ago, women and those groups of people that we know little about. Ironically, these groups belong to a population sector that is the one at greater risk of having mental health problems because they live with several disadvantages at the same time. For example, being poor, delinquent, and lesbian, could mean having to live in a triple stigmatized sphere of the society. The objectives of this paper is to reflect about the social research and the cualitative methods traditionally used to gain access to hidden populations and to briefly describe the issues approached by the National Institute of Psychiatry, as well as the ethical problems, risks and challenges researchers face nowadays. Qualitative strategies Not all investigation is carried out at universities, research centers or other academic centers. Besides traditional ethnography and participant and non-participating observation, there are four methods which are the most commonly used to research hidden populations: in-depth interviews, semi-structured interviews, snowball sampling and other forms of chain referral, sampling with key informants and target sampling. Some researchers include also focus and discussion groups. Ethnography and the ethnographic research centers Ethnography is a social research method where the researcher participates, openly or in a hidden way, in a person's life for a relatively long period of time, observing what happens, listening, and asking things. In brief, recollecting every kind of available which may shed some light on the topic being studied. There are disagreements on whether the main ethnographic characteristic is the register of the cultural knowledge (Spradley, 1980), the detailed research of social interaction patterns (Gumperz, 1981) or the holistic analysis of a society. In some occasions, it is considered as descriptive and in others as a way to record oral narratives. Nevertheless its most important characteristic is named only a few times: the development and verification of social theories (Denzin, 1994). Ethnography is the more basic form of social research. The Chicago School, which followed these traditions, would ask participants to obtain an empirical comprehension of the world, aiming for the ""member's perspectives"", observing the human group in a natural way and staying in situ (Adler, 1990). This school recommended staying in a marginal way in order to achieve objectiveness. But as new epistemological paradigms were developed, it was observed that the strongest point of field-work was that subjective approach, which allowed the researcher to realize that there is not such a thing as not influencing the research place.",Cited By :8, ,, , , , ,,,, , , ,"Affiliation: Investigadora en Cie.

Fifty four Latino immigrant parents participated in in-depth semi-structured interviews. Interviews were completed between September 2013 and February 2014, a critical time period following passage and initial stages of the implementation of SB1070 and other anti-immigration policies. Informed by grounded theory, a constant comparative approach was used between and within transcripts while completing initial and focused coding. Findings indicate parents observed a range of behavioral changes in their children following the passage of anti-immigration legislation. The emotional impact experienced by Latino children is summarized in the following themes; concern and sense of responsibility, fear and hypervigilance, sadness and crying, and depression. Parents reported their children expressed constant fear and concern over the looming threat of deportation or family separation. Children exhibited a sense of responsibility for improving their families' circumstances. Parents expressed their children displayed hypervigilance, constant sadness and crying. In some instances the changes in children's behavior were so severe that parents considered their children to be depressed and in need of clinical intervention.

This project involved three studies. Study 1 involved (a) qualitative review of published literature, professional codes of ethics, and critical incidents of (un)ethical performance and resulted in (b) behavioral dimensions and ethical performance rating scales. The second and third studies used a retranslation methodology to evaluate the ethical performance dimensions from Study 1. The behavioral dimensions were linked to the performance determinants (personal attributes) in Study 3. Study 1 resulted in draft dimension definitions and rating scales for 10 ethical performance dimensions. In Studies 2 and 3, retranslation data provided strong support for 10 behavioral dimensions of ethical performance at work. Results from Study 3 shed light on possible relationships among the performance dimensions based on their underlying performance determinants. Communicating an organization's ethical standards to employees is important because some ethical breakdowns can be attributed to simply failing to recognize an ethical matter (in: DeCremer, Managerial ethics: Managing the psychology of morality, Routledge, New York, 2011). Definitions of ethical behavior in the workplace provide a tool for researchers, employers, and employees to communicate about ethical situations and a foundation for folding ethics into employee training and performance management. These studies provide a taxonomy of ethical performance at work that generalizes to a diverse array of occupations and industries, and dimensions and rating scales have value for performance management, training/curriculum development, job analysis, predictor development and/or validation, and additional research.}", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,0889-3268}, ,"Russell, TL (Reprint Author), Human Resources Res Org, 100 Washington Ave South,Suite 1660, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA.

Subsequently, parent training provided through correctional programming has the potential to impact a large number of American children affected by parental incarceration. However, there are no empirically supported â€œbest practicesâ€ for parenting programs provided during incarceration and programs often vary across facilities. The current study examines an existing parenting class offered within a correctional facility and a parenting class modeled from Parentâ€“Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), a program with an existing evidence base for improving parent and child outcomes. Eighty-two women incarcerated in a female, state correctional facility were randomized to one of the two parenting models. Both parenting models were matched in dose to the facility's existing program, of weekly, 90-minute, group parenting classes, consisting of 10â€“15 mothers. Seventy-one women completed the parenting classes. Participants in both models were combined for pre-treatment and post-treatment assessments that included group administration of self-report measures and individual behavior observations of parenting interaction role-plays. At post-treatment, mothers completing the PCIT-based training demonstrated higher levels of parenting skills and reported higher levels of treatment satisfaction than mothers completing the existing facility class. Mothers completing the existing class reported higher levels of parenting knowledge of child development than the PCIT-based class.

This paper estimates the mean and distributional impact of single-sex high schools on studentsâ€™ cognitive achievement, major choice, and test-taking behaviorâ€”by exploiting the random assignment policy adopted in Seoul, Korea. Based on administrative data for a period of seven years, I find that, on average, the positive effects of single-sex schooling on test scores are small, especially when the parental and teacher sorting are accounted for. Although the magnitude of the estimated effects is small, I find that the effect is relatively larger for students in quantiles 0.5â€“0.8 of the distribution of test scores. The impact is trivial, on the other hand, for students located at the very bottom and the very top quantiles.

Multiply oppressive contexts are characterized by exposure to oppression at a societal level (distal oppression), in the immediate environment (proximal oppression), and at an individual level (personal oppression). We replicated and extended Perez and Soto's (2011) findings by examining whether the reappraisal-psychological functioning association was moderated by (a) relative numerical representation of Latinos within the environment (proximal oppression) and (b) personal perceptions of discrimination (personal oppression) among 425 Latino college students throughout the United States. For Latinos in high-Latino counties, greater use of reappraisal was associated with better psychological functioning, regardless of perceived discrimination; this relationship was absent for Latinos in low-Latino counties who perceived greater discrimination.

Yet, attending to their experiences may yield a wealth of strategies for system change and for other women to change their path or avoid child welfare system involvement altogether. Using augmented qualitative analytic methods from two phenomenological studies that utilized the life histories approach, the current study lifts up the voices of 15 women of color with past child welfare involvement as foster youth (and, for many, as mothers). The study findings highlight experiences within two broad themes: a) immense insecurity; and b) resilience, across domains in the lives of child welfare affected women. The mothers in this study share their insights into the aftermath of complex trauma and substance abuse within their families, particularly the relational, housing, and financial insecurity it wreaked as well as how they garnered resilience through perseverance, faith and empathy, and establishing stable homes.

We use partial frontier approaches to mitigate the influence of outliers and the curse of dimensionality. Our estimation considers idiosyncratic variables at the school, class, and student levels.

Results are in line with previous findings that less than 30% of the variance in studentsâ€™ educational attainment is attributable to their schools. Results also corroborate that a model considering only student-level variables yields high inefficiencies not attributable to school management, but rather to inadequate resource-endowment policy. Therefore, when disregarding specific variables concerning the resources allocated to the schools, the performance of those schools is undervalued, largely because inefficiencies caused by suboptimal resource endowments or difficulties arising from the socioeconomic environment are instead attributed to poor school management.", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,0272-7757, , , , , , , , ,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775712001082,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2012.08.002, , , , ,ScienceDirect, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Track-by-school fixed effects therefore render peer group composition conditionally uncorrelated with studentsâ€™ characteristics, while track fixed effects and school fixed effects donâ€™t.

In particular, we discuss the importance of the following: a reflective stance, challenging negative representations, flexible and sensitive recruitment strategies, validating experiences of stigma, and participant control and power. We see these points as particularly important in the context of researching stigma as outsiders, where our privilege may contribute to unhelpful, narrow, de-politicized or overly simplistic representations of particular â€œgroupsâ€ or experiences. We share these considerations in hope of assisting other researchers to reflect on, and articulate, how they negotiate their positionings within their research and the ways in which they shape and construct the research agenda and, by implication, the people or topics under examination.

Utilizing the Early Childhood Longitudinal Studyâ€“Kindergarten 1998 and 2010 cohorts and combined with data from the U.S. Census and American Community Survey, we find that the proportion of kindergarten children living in moderate and high poverty neighborhoods increased from 1998 to 2010, and that these increases were most pronounced for non-poor and white children. Using OLS and fixed effects regression analyses and holding family poverty constant, we find that children in neighborhoods with higher levels of poverty start school less ready to learn than their peers. Specifically, children from the highest poverty neighborhoods start school almost a year behind children from the lowest poverty neighborhoods in terms of their academic skills. In addition, we find that the academic skills gap between poor- and non-poor children within neighborhood poverty categories grew from 1998 to 2010, particularly in high poverty neighborhoods. These findings appear to be explained both by changes in the composition of families within neighborhood poverty categories and income increases among non-poor families. The findings indicate that neighborhood poverty may be a useful proxy to identify children and families in need of additional support.", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,0190-7409, , , , , , , , ,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740917301731,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.06.040, , , , ,ScienceDirect, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Of particular interest is whether students in higher education today conceptualize integrity as comprising such broader attributes as personal and social responsibility. We collected and analyzed qualitative responses from 127 students at the National University of Singapore to understand how they define integrity in their lives as students, and how they envisage integrity would be demonstrated in their lives after university. Consistent with the current literature, our data showed that integrity was predominantly taken as ``not plagiarizing (in school)/giving appropriate credit when credit is due (in the workplace){'' ``not cheating{'' and ``completing tasks independently{''}. The survey, though, also revealed further perceptions such as, in a university context, ``not manipulating data (e.g., scientific integrity){'' ``being honest with others{'' ``group work commitments{'' ``conscience/moral ethics/holding true to ones beliefs{'' ``being honest with oneself{'' ``upholding a strong work ethic{'' ``going against conventions{'' and ``reporting others{'' as well as, in a workplace context, ``power and responsibility and its implications{'' ``professionalism{'' and ``representing or being loyal to an organization{''}. The findings suggest that some students see the notion of integrity extending beyond good academic conduct. It is worthwhile to (re)think more broadly what (else) integrity means, discover the gaps in our students understanding of integrity, and consider how best we can teach integrity to prepare students for future challenges to integrity and ethical dilemmas.}", , ,, , , , ,,,, ,1664-1078}, ,"Lim, SWH (Reprint Author), Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Arts \& Social Sci, Dept Psychol, Singapore, Singapore.
